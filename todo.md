```

#### NodeJS  133. SuperTest: 1’10 ⚠️
* I've already installed and created the 1st test (GET)
* For POST test, as soon as the POST is done, check [Class 134]('https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-nodejs-developer-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/26199790#overview') 

#### Focus on essentials only!!! 👀
* What are the **trully main features** we need as a 1st version?
* What's the **priority**?
* After that, **review if the next features still make sense**.
* What's the **priority now**?

# Typescript ( ⏳ Let's wait for now and do it later if necessary )
#### NodeJS 394. TypeScript Installation

#### CRUD for Users
1. Register + email confirmation
2. Login

#### Note about the sequence:
1. Server > App
2.1 Foward approach: Router > Controller > Model
2.2 Bottom UP approach: Model > Router > Controller
